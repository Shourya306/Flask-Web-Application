# Steps for running in local computer:

STEP-1: Install all the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt file. You can run the following command in your command prompt to install all the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

STEP-2: After installing all the dependencies, open command prompt from the direction where app.py file is present and run the following command:

streamlit run app.py

That's it, you can see the web application running at you localhost.
